# ubercart_order_hide
Hide Ubercart order details from people who shouldn't see them.

This way you can build a public display of order info (summary, for example) without needing to worry about order details being exposed.

On your View, edit the Query options and check "Disable SQL rewriting." This has security implications, so beware.
